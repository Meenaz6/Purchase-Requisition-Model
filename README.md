🛒 Purchase Requisition Management System (Odoo Custom Module)

This is a custom Purchase Requisition system developed within the Odoo Purchase module. It is designed to streamline internal procurement processes by allowing employees or departments to create purchase requisitions for products and services. These requisitions are then reviewed and approved by the procurement team before converting them into Purchase Orders (POs).

This system ensures better visibility, control, and traceability over the purchasing workflow, eliminating informal requests and manual communication.
